## To install libs after git clone
    npm install

## To run locally in dev mode (view at http://localhost:5173/)
    npm run dev

## To build for production (files compiled in /dist directory)
    npm run build

## To deploy
    git push origin main

A git push to the project's main branch will automatically redeploy the website on the host (Netlify).

There is no need to do a build before pushing. Netlify will handle the 'npm run build'.

Obviously it is necessary to do a 'git add' and 'git commit' before the push for changes to be included.
